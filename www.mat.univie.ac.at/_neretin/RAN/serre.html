Dear colleagues,
<br><br>
I have been told about the possible suppression (disguised as an improvement) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This is an incredible piece of news. I don't remember any such thing happening to an Academy, even less to one with such a glorious past. What is going to happen to those well-known journals of yours, such as Doklady and Izvestja? (I had three times the honor of publishing a paper in Izvestja: twice in French, and once in English.)
<br><br>
I know that my French colleagues feel as I do; they are going to write to you soon, to express their support.
<br><br>
I very much hope that your Academy will survive this crisis.
<br><br>
Avec toutes mes amities
<br><br>
